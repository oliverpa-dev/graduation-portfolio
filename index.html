              The Graduation Internship Portfolio, including the documentation
              of the internship has been crafted in adherence to the guidelines
              provided by Fontys University of Applied Sciences. This
              compilation serves as a reflective showcase of my journey and the
              tasks undertaken during my graduation internship at Cape.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to express my appreciation to Fontys University of Applied
              Sciences and the ICT department for providing students with a wide
              range of partner companies, offering diverse internship
              opportunities. This experience has broadened my career horizons,
              equipping me for a future in the Media Design sector.
            </p>
            <p>
              A special note of thanks goes to Mr. Frank Roosen, my internship
              teacher coordinator, for his consistent support, guidance, and
              patient assistance throughout the writing process. His
              constructive and effective feedback on various versions of the
              Portfolio during the internship has been instrumental.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also extend my gratitude to Soroush, my supervisor at Cape, for
              his guidance, feedback, and trust in my professional capabilities
              during the internship.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would like to acknowledge Silas for providing valuable
              assistance and guidance during meetings, especially in the
              researching phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to my parents, whose
              unwavering support sustained me throughout the four years of study
              in a foreign country.

            <p>
              The graduation internship took place at Cape, a Tilburg-based
              software company specializing in Software-as-a-Service platforms.
              Cape is driven by a passion for innovative technologies that aim
              to enable marketers, designers, and media teams to unleash their
              full potential, allowing them to concentrate on what truly
              matters; the creation of more pertinent and high-performing
              campaigns. This project delves into the settings of the entire
              platform and its functionality. The main goal of the assignment is
              to create a user-friendly and scalable method for non-developers
              to independently create, edit, and manage settings. The desired
              solution includes a clickable interface that allows non-developers
              to manage the settings.

            <h1 class="margin-bottom">Introduction</h1>
            <p>
              Embarking on a transformative exploration of the Design Thinking
              methodology, this portfolio unfolds its narrative by immersing
              itself in the Empathize phase. Here, a deep dive into the current
              state of settings and the nuanced needs of the target audience
              lays the foundation for the subsequent phases. Transitioning to
              the Define phase, the portfolio distills key findings derived from
              meticulous observations and interviews into a concise and
              insightful summary.
            </p>
            <p>
              The journey advances to the Ideate phase, where a panoramic view
              of settings management in diverse SaaS platforms unfolds. A
              meticulous examination of their content in the context of user
              experience and usability is accompanied by a journey through user
              flow and the conceptualization of initial sketches. Advancing
              smoothly, the storyline seamlessly shifts into the Prototype
              phase, where the wireframes are crafted, leading to the creation
              of a prototype.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Testing phase, a comprehensive review of usability analysis
              unfolds, prompting iterations through the prototype.
              Simultaneously, a MoSCoW analysis is crafted, delineating the
              elements earmarked for implementation in the interface and
              establishing their priorities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Concluding with insights and counsel, the portfolio wraps up by
              offering an advice and a self-reflections based on the entire
              internship journey.

                  <p>
                    The tool for
                    managing campaigns utilizes various
                    channels including: Display,
                    Social, Video,
                    Mobile, and Email, each of which
                    has its own <span>editable specifications</span> within a
                    campaign. These campaigns can encompass
                    <span>modules</span>, <span>markets</span>,
                    <span>languages</span>, <span>brands</span>, and
                    <span>departments</span>, each serving distinct
                    functionalities based on <span>user permissions</span>. The
                    Multi market functionality allows for the
                    assignment of different markets to a campaign, while
                    <span>languages</span> the display language and
                    offer <span>automatic translation.</span>
                    <span>User roles</span> are customizable and
                    <span>configurable</span>, with permissions determined by
                    the client's subscription.
                    <span>Categories and tags</span> provide
                    <span>filtering</span> and additional information for
                    campaigns, replacing the previous categorization by types.
                    Lastly, campaign status indicates whether a
                    campaign is upcoming, live, or
                    offline, defining its current state. User roles
                    should be fixed for the customers with a space for creating
                    a <span>personalized role</span>.

                    robust and flexible solution for
                    customers to efficiently <span>setup</span> and
                    <span>manage</span> their campaigns. The
                    customization options provided in the customer

                    of <span>JSON format</span>, allows users to tailor
                    campaigns to specific departments,
                    markets, and brands.The
                    incorporation of categories and
                    tags as metadata enhances campaign
                    description and facilitates effective
                    filtration. Moreover, Cape's campaign
                    <span>calendar tool</span> acts as a
                    <span>centralized hub</span>, streamlining
                    management efforts through

                    Analysis on <span>self-service</span> main setup indicates
                    varying frequencies of
                    <span>JSON configuration adjustments</span>, with users
                    reporting <span>daily</span> or infrequent
                    <span>modifications</span>, often focusing on
                    Asset Management configurations.
                    Challenges include the <span>risk of making JSON
                    files invalid</span>, difficulties understanding
                    module relationships and user rights, and a
                    reliance on documentation.
                    Critical settings for modification encompass
                    <span>markets</span>, <span>departments</span>,
                    <span>brands</span>, <span>modules</span>,

                    <span>Errors</span> are considered <span>critical</span>,
                    with potential to crash the environment, and
                    confidence levels in validating JSON code
                    varied. Frustrations include the perceived
                    and non-tech individuals. Desired features include a
                    <span>"no-code"</span> solution,
                    <span>user-friendly web forms, graphical interfaces</span>,
                    and integration of default values with
                    flexibility and <span>customization</span> emphasized. However,
                    the option to <span>fall back to the previous JSON interface should be considered</span>.

            <p>
              I delved into users' experiences with the self-service main setup,
              uncovering varying frequencies of JSON configuration adjustments
              and associated challenges. Users expressed frustrations,
              particularly around the perceived complexity for beginners,
              leading to a strong desire for "no-code" solutions and
              user-friendly interfaces. Concerns about errors, backward
              compatibility, and transitioning from JSON were also identified.
              As I transition into the "Define" stage, these insights serve as
              the foundation.

                  In the course of the <span>wireframing process</span>, several
                  <span>iterations</span> were undertaken to enhance the
                  <span>user interface</span> and <span>functionality</span>.
                  The <span>initial wireframe</span> highlighted areas of
                  improvement, such as
                  <span>non-functional button colors</span> and the need for
                  better descriptions in various settings. The
                  <span>second iteration</span> addressed concerns on the
                  <span>General Page, Business, Modules</span>, and
                  <span>Users sections</span>, emphasizing the importance of
                  descriptive headlines and streamlined alignment for improved
                  visual appeal and user experience.
                  <span>Specific suggestions</span> were made for various
                  settings, including adding descriptions for
                  <span>user roles</span> and explanations for language
                  settings. The <span>third iteration</span> introduced the
                  concept of grouping modules to establish a visual hierarchy,
                  contributing to a more organized and intuitive layout. This
                  demonstrated a commitment to refining the wireframe based on
                  <span>user feedback</span>. The
                  <span>fourth iteration</span> focused on making options with
                  sub-options editable and including
                  <span>module descriptions</span> for a clearer understanding.
                  Additionally, recommendations were made to combine
                  <span>management and publishing</span> in the
                  <span>Channels section</span>, streamlining the user interface
                  further. In the <span>fifth and final iteration</span> before
                  <span>prototype creation</span>, the wireframe incorporated
                  the accumulated feedback, ensuring a high-fidelity
                  representation of the refined design. The
                  <span>iterative process</span> showcased a commitment to
                  <span>user-centric improvements</span>, resulting in a
                  wireframe that lays a solid foundation for the subsequent
                  <span>prototype development</span>.
