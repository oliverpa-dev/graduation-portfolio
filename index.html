              The Graduation Internship Portfolio, including the documentation
              of the internship has been crafted in adherence to the guidelines

              compilation serves as a reflective showcase of my journey and the
              tasks undertaken during my graduation internship at Cape.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to express my appreciation to Fontys University of Applied
              Sciences and the ICT department for providing students with a wide
              range of partner companies, offering diverse internship
              opportunities. This experience has broadened my career horizons,
              equipping me for a future in the Media Design sector.
            </p>
            <p>
              A special note of thanks goes to Mr. Frank Roosen, my internship
              teacher coordinator, for his consistent support, guidance, and
              patient assistance throughout the writing process. His
              constructive and effective feedback on various versions of the
              Portfolio during the internship has been instrumental.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also extend my gratitude to Soroush, my supervisor at Cape, for
              his guidance, feedback, and trust in my professional capabilities
              during the internship.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would like to acknowledge Silas for providing valuable
              assistance and guidance during meetings, especially in the
              researching phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to my parents, whose
              unwavering support sustained me throughout the four years of study
              in a foreign country.

            <p>
              The graduation internship took place at Cape, a Tilburg-based
              software company specializing in Software-as-a-Service platforms.
              Cape is driven by a passion for innovative technologies that aim
              to enable marketers, designers, and media teams to unleash their
              full potential, allowing them to concentrate on what truly
              matters; the creation of more pertinent and high-performing
              campaigns. This project delves into the settings of the entire
              platform and its functionality. The main goal of the assignment is
              to create a user-friendly and scalable method for non-developers
              to independently create, edit, and manage settings. The desired
              solution includes a clickable interface that allows non-developers
              to manage the settings.

            <h1 class="margin-bottom">Introduction</h1>
            <p>
              Embarking on a transformative exploration of the Design Thinking
              methodology, this portfolio unfolds its narrative by immersing
              itself in the Empathize phase. Here, a deep dive into the current
              state of settings and the nuanced needs of the target audience
              lays the foundation for the subsequent phases. Transitioning to
              the Define phase, the portfolio distills key findings derived from
              meticulous observations and interviews into a concise and
              insightful summary.
            </p>
            <p>
              The journey advances to the Ideate phase, where a panoramic view
              of settings management in diverse SaaS platforms unfolds. A
              meticulous examination of their content in the context of user
              experience and usability is accompanied by a journey through user
              flow and the conceptualization of initial sketches. Advancing
              smoothly, the storyline seamlessly shifts into the Prototype
              phase, where the wireframes are crafted, leading to the creation
              of a prototype.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Testing phase, a comprehensive review of usability analysis
              unfolds, prompting iterations through the prototype.
              Simultaneously, a MoSCoW analysis is crafted, delineating the
              elements earmarked for implementation in the interface and
              establishing their priorities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Concluding with insights and counsel, the portfolio wraps up by
              offering an advice and a self-reflections based on the entire
              internship journey.

                    The <span>tool</span> for
                    <span>managing campaigns</span> utilizes various
                    <span>channels</span>, including <span>Display,</span>
                    <span>Social,</span> <span>Video,</span>
                    <span>Mobile,</span> and <span>Email</span>, each of which
                    has its own <span>editable specifications</span> within a
                    campaign. These campaigns can encompass
                    <span>modules</span>, <span>markets</span>,
                    <span>languages</span>, <span>brands</span>, and
                    <span>departments</span>, each serving distinct
                    functionalities based on <span>user permissions</span>. The
                    <span>Multi market functionality</span> allows for the
                    assignment of different markets to a campaign, while
                    <span>languages determine</span> the display language and
                    offer <span>automatic translation capabilities.</span>
                    <span>User roles</span> are <span>customizable</span> and
                    <span>configurable</span>, with permissions determined by
                    the client's subscription.
                    <span>Categories and tags</span> provide
                    <span>filtering</span> and additional information for
                    campaigns, replacing the previous categorization by types.
                    Lastly, <span>campaign status</span> indicates whether a
                    campaign is <span>upcoming</span>, <span>live</span>, or
                    <span>offline</span>, defining its current state. User roles
                    should be fixed for the customers with a space for creating
                    a <span>personalized role</span>.
                    <span>This comprehensive</span> understanding of the tool's
                    <span>components</span> and <span>features</span> is

                    It's incredibly frustrating that using JSON for setting up
                    the environment not only increases the risk of errors but
                    also imposes a steep learning curve for reading and editing
                    JSON, which is completely unnecessary. This unnecessary
                    complexity makes it excessively difficult for some to make
                    simple changes, and it's a source of continuous frustration.

            <p>
              I delved into users' experiences with the self-service main setup,
              uncovering varying frequencies of JSON configuration adjustments
              and associated challenges. Users expressed frustrations,
              particularly around the perceived complexity for beginners,
              leading to a strong desire for "no-code" solutions and
              user-friendly interfaces. Concerns about errors, backward
              compatibility, and transitioning from JSON were also identified.
              As I transition into the "Define" stage, these insights serve as
              the foundation. A focused effort will be made to address the
              identified frustrations and problems.

                    Certainly, here are the most important parts of the text
                    highlighted:
                    <span>Information architecture (IA)</span> functions as a
                    <span>visual blueprint</span> representing a product's
                    structure and features. The <span>level of detail</span> in
                    IA, covering navigation, application functions, content, and
                    workflows, is at the designer's discretion. While IA has no
                    strict size or format constraints, it must convey the
                    product's core structure for universal understanding. Just
                    as a blueprint provides an overview of a building, IA offers
                    a high-level grasp for designers, development teams, and
                    engineers, crucial for informed decision-making and product
                    development. Crafting IA mirrors the process of creating
                    flowcharts, emphasizing visual hierarchy and clarity.
                    Overcoming the challenge of hierarchical construction in IA
                    is essential, especially when starting from scratch. A
                    well-structured IA simplifies navigation and user
                    comprehension. Ultimately, effective IA streamlines
                    development, decision-making, and user-centered design in
                    the realm of UX.

                  concept of grouping modules to establish a visual hierarchy,
                  contributing to a more organized and intuitive layout. This
                  demonstrated a commitment to refining the wireframe based on
                  <span>user feedback</span>. The
                  <span>fourth iteration</span> focused on making options with
                  sub-options editable and including
                  <span>module descriptions</span> for a clearer understanding.
                  Additionally, recommendations were made to combine
                  <span>management and publishing</span> in the
                  <span>Channels section</span>, streamlining the user interface
                  further. In the <span>fifth and final iteration</span> before
                  <span>prototype creation</span>, the wireframe incorporated
                  the accumulated feedback, ensuring a high-fidelity
                  representation of the refined design. The

                  In conclusion, the <span>Modules and Features</span> Page
                  underwent significant refinements, introducing additional
                  descriptions, enhanced <span>filtering options</span>, and a
                  streamlined presentation of
                  <span>license-based</span> features with <span>toggles</span>.
                  The inclusion of <span>nested settings</span> displaying a
                  preview and the introduction of an <span>"Edit"</span> button
                  for <span>editable options</span> aim to provide users with a
                  more intuitive and informative experience. The associated
                  modals now offer improved functionality, allowing users to
                  <span>select/deselect all</span> options,
                  <span>add new tags</span>, and benefit from additional labels
                  for clarity. Similarly, the <span>User Roles Page</span> saw
                  notable improvements, transitioning from
                  <span>user permissions</span> to <span>User roles</span>. This
                  shift includes <span>predefined roles</span>, an
                  <span>authority level</span> to prevent misuse, and a
                  user-friendly interface for
                  <span>searching and filtering</span> rights. The highlighting
                  of the selected role with displayed assigned rights
                  contributes to a clearer representation of
                  <span>user roles and responsibilities</span>, collectively
                  enhancing the overall <span>usability</span> of the system.

                  Throughout the project, we followed Gibbs' Reflective Cycle to
                  reflect on our experiences and progress. We started with a
                  brainstorming session, generating potential solutions for
                  sound levels and stress management in physical education
                  classes. Research and evaluation of existing apps provided
                  valuable insights, leading to the development of an
                  interconnected ecosystem centered around a smartwatch app. We
                  visualized the user journey, prioritized features using the
                  MoSCoW Analysis, and collaborated to merge individual
                  prototypes into a cohesive final version. UML diagrams played
                  a crucial role in documenting the system's architecture,
                  fostering effective communication. User feedback and
                  observations guided iterative refinements, resulting in a
                  well-crafted home screen prototype. The feedback analysis
                  highlighted positive aspects, such as visual appeal and
                  usability, while also identifying areas for improvement. We
                  will make necessary adjustments and continue refining the
                  design based on user preferences and stakeholder requirements
                  to achieve our desired outcomes..
