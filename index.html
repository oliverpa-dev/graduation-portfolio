              The Graduation Internship Portfolio, including the documentation
              of the internship has been crafted in adherence to the guidelines
              provided by Fontys University of Applied Sciences. This
              compilation serves as a reflective showcase of my journey and the
              tasks undertaken during my graduation internship at Cape.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to express my appreciation to Fontys University of Applied
              Sciences and the ICT department for providing students with a wide
              range of partner companies, offering diverse internship
              opportunities. This experience has broadened my career horizons,
              equipping me for a future in the Media Design sector.
            </p>
            <p>
              A special note of thanks goes to Mr. Frank Roosen, my internship
              teacher coordinator, for his consistent support, guidance, and
              patient assistance throughout the writing process. His
              constructive and effective feedback on various versions of the
              Portfolio during the internship has been instrumental.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also extend my gratitude to Soroush, my supervisor at Cape, for
              his guidance, feedback, and trust in my professional capabilities
              during the internship.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would like to acknowledge Silas for providing valuable
              assistance and guidance during meetings, especially in the
              researching phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to my parents, whose
              unwavering support sustained me throughout the four years of study
              in a foreign country.

            <p>
              The graduation internship took place at Cape, a Tilburg-based
              software company specializing in Software-as-a-Service platforms.
              Cape is driven by a passion for innovative technologies that aim
              to enable marketers, designers, and media teams to unleash their
              full potential, allowing them to concentrate on what truly
              matters; the creation of more pertinent and high-performing
              campaigns. This project delves into the settings of the entire
              platform and its functionality. The main goal of the assignment is
              to create a user-friendly and scalable method for non-developers
              to independently create, edit, and manage settings. The desired
              solution includes a clickable interface that allows non-developers
              to manage the settings.

            <h1 class="margin-bottom">Introduction</h1>
            <p>
              Embarking on a transformative exploration of the Design Thinking
              methodology, this portfolio unfolds its narrative by immersing
              itself in the Empathize phase. Here, a deep dive into the current
              state of settings and the nuanced needs of the target audience
              lays the foundation for the subsequent phases. Transitioning to
              the Define phase, the portfolio distills key findings derived from
              meticulous observations and interviews into a concise and
              insightful summary.
            </p>
            <p>
              The journey advances to the Ideate phase, where a panoramic view
              of settings management in diverse SaaS platforms unfolds. A
              meticulous examination of their content in the context of user
              experience and usability is accompanied by a journey through user
              flow and the conceptualization of initial sketches. Advancing
              smoothly, the storyline seamlessly shifts into the Prototype
              phase, where the wireframes are crafted, leading to the creation
              of a prototype.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Testing phase, a comprehensive review of usability analysis
              unfolds, prompting iterations through the prototype.
              Simultaneously, a MoSCoW analysis is crafted, delineating the
              elements earmarked for implementation in the interface and
              establishing their priorities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Concluding with insights and counsel, the portfolio wraps up by
              offering an advice and a self-reflections based on the entire
              internship journey.

                    The <span>tool</span> for
                    <span>managing campaigns</span> utilizes various
                    <span>channels</span>, including <span>Display,</span>
                    <span>Social,</span> <span>Video,</span>
                    <span>Mobile,</span> and <span>Email</span>, each of which
                    has its own <span>editable specifications</span> within a
                    campaign. These campaigns can encompass
                    <span>modules</span>, <span>markets</span>,
                    <span>languages</span>, <span>brands</span>, and
                    <span>departments</span>, each serving distinct
                    functionalities based on <span>user permissions</span>. The
                    <span>Multi market functionality</span> allows for the
                    assignment of different markets to a campaign, while
                    <span>languages determine</span> the display language and
                    offer <span>automatic translation capabilities.</span>
                    <span>User roles</span> are <span>customizable</span> and
                    <span>configurable</span>, with permissions determined by
                    the client's subscription.
                    <span>Categories and tags</span> provide
                    <span>filtering</span> and additional information for
                    campaigns, replacing the previous categorization by types.
                    Lastly, <span>campaign status</span> indicates whether a
                    campaign is <span>upcoming</span>, <span>live</span>, or
                    <span>offline</span>, defining its current state. User roles
                    should be fixed for the customers with a space for creating
                    a <span>personalized role</span>.
                    <span>This comprehensive</span> understanding of the tool's
                    <span>components</span> and <span>features</span> is

                    <span>modifications</span>, often focusing on
                    <span>Asset Management configurations</span>.
                    <span>Challenges</span> include the risk of making JSON

                    <span>confidence levels</span> in validating JSON code
                    varied. Frustrations include the perceived
                    <span>complexity for beginners</span>
                    and non-tech individuals. Desired features include a

                    <span>user-friendly web forms, graphical interfaces</span>,

                    It's incredibly frustrating that using JSON for setting up
                    the environment not only increases the risk of errors but
                    also imposes a steep learning curve for reading and editing
                    JSON, which is completely unnecessary. This unnecessary
                    complexity makes it excessively difficult for some to make
                    simple changes, and it's a source of continuous frustration.

            <p>
              I delved into users' experiences with the self-service main setup,
              uncovering varying frequencies of JSON configuration adjustments
              and associated challenges. Users expressed frustrations,
              particularly around the perceived complexity for beginners,
              leading to a strong desire for "no-code" solutions and
              user-friendly interfaces. Concerns about errors, backward
              compatibility, and transitioning from JSON were also identified.
              As I transition into the "Define" stage, these insights serve as
              the foundation. A focused effort will be made to address the
              identified frustrations and problems.

                    However, differences arise in customization levels and
                    navigation clarity, showcasing each app's unique balance
                    between simplicity and functionality. <span>Monday stands out</span> for
                    its clarity, clear labeling, and organized permissions.
                    <span>Asana's thoughtful design and dynamic presentation of
                      sub-settings enhance user convenience, while Basecamp
                      focuses on a simplified user experience but faces usability
                      challenges in navigation. Trello excels with an intuitive
                      modal interface and nested sub-settings</span>, aided by a top
                    indicator for user-friendly navigation. <span>Jira combines
                      user-friendly design with high customization options,
                      providing efficient user management through structured
                      tables and dropdown menus.</span> Each application offers a
                    tailored approach to meeting user needs in the realm of

                  When exploring the main page, referred to as the Dashboard,
                  users won't find a direct icon for accessing settings.
                  Instead, a user-friendly approach requires clicking on the
                  profile picture in the top right corner, revealing a modal
                  with various redirecting links, including the option to access
                  settings. This design choice optimizes user experience by
                  seamlessly integrating icons with text labels. Upon selecting
                  the settings link, a new page unfolds, presenting primary
                  settings on the left sidebar and their corresponding content
                  on the right side. These primary settings are meticulously
                  explained, complemented by icon-text labels, and feature a
                  distinctive background color upon selection, fostering an
                  intuitive user experience. Effortless navigation through
                  different settings and sub-settings is facilitated by a
                  consistent design and layout maintained across each section.
                  Each sub-setting is thoughtfully described, enhanced with
                  visuals and text, contributing to a smooth and enriching user
                  interaction.

                    blueprint representing a product's structure and features.
                    The level of detail in IA, covering navigation, application
                    functions, content, and workflows, is at the designer's
                    discretion. While IA has no strict size or format
                    constraints, it must convey the product's core structure for
                    universal understanding. Just as a blueprint provides an
                    overview of a building, IA offers a high-level grasp for
                    designers, development teams, and engineers, crucial for
                    informed decision-making and product development. Crafting
                    IA mirrors the process of creating flowcharts, emphasizing

                    hierarchical construction in IA is essential, especially

                  In the course of the wireframing process, several iterations
                  were undertaken to enhance the user interface and
                  functionality. The initial wireframe highlighted areas of
                  improvement, such as non-functional button colors and the need
                  for better descriptions in various settings. The second
                  iteration addressed concerns on the General Page, Business,
                  Modules, and Users sections, emphasizing the importance of
                  descriptive headlines and streamlined alignment for improved
                  visual appeal and user experience. Specific suggestions were
                  made for various settings, including adding descriptions for
                  user roles and explanations for language settings. The third
                  iteration introduced the concept of grouping modules to
                  establish a visual hierarchy, contributing to a more organized
                  and intuitive layout. This demonstrated a commitment to
                  refining the wireframe based on user feedback. The fourth
                  iteration focused on making options with sub-options editable
                  and including module descriptions for a clearer understanding.
                  Additionally, recommendations were made to combine management
                  and publishing in the Channels section, streamlining the user
                  interface further. In the fifth and final iteration before
                  prototype creation, the wireframe incorporated the accumulated
                  feedback, ensuring a high-fidelity representation of the
                  refined design. The iterative process showcased a commitment
                  to user-centric improvements, resulting in a wireframe that
                  lays a solid foundation for the subsequent prototype
                  development.

                  As a collaborative team, we utilized the Useberry platform to
                  integrate targeted questions and user flows specific to the
                  sections we designed. This enabled us to gather valuable
                  feedback on our design choices. I took the lead in conducting
                  usability testing on the dosage timeline screen flow and also
                  performed A/B testing on the latest iterations of the
                  prototype that I developed. Initially, we faced some
                  challenges during the test deployment, which prompted me to
                  make necessary adjustments to the prototype overnight,
                  ensuring a smooth and effective testing experience the
                  following day. This iterative testing process allowed us to
                  gather valuable insights and refine our design to enhance its
                  usability and user satisfaction.

                  In summary, the analysis of the testing sessions reveals a
                  generally successful implementation of the addition of a new
                  brand, department, and market, demonstrating seamless
                  execution and a user-friendly approach. The introduction of a
                  toggle for customization in Task 1 is acknowledged for
                  providing flexibility. However, feedback suggests areas of
                  improvement, particularly in Task 2, where the creation of a
                  new user role highlighted the need for clearer navigation and
                  a more intuitive presentation of roles and permissions. In
                  Task 3, participants recommended streamlining the user
                  interface by reconsidering the terminology used for "Modules."
                  The overall sentiment across Tasks 4 to 8 indicates
                  well-received functionalities, with minor challenges noted in
                  locating options and a desire for more visual representations.
                  User suggestions for merging Channel Management and
                  Publishing, adding connection state indicators, and refining
                  terminology collectively highlight opportunities for enhancing
                  the platform's cohesion and user-friendliness. Participants
                  generally rated their experience positively at a commendable
                  level of 4, with some initial challenges, particularly related
                  to Sidebar visibility, promptly addressed. These insights
                  collectively offer valuable perspectives for refining the
                  platform's clarity and terminology, contributing to an
                  improved and more user-centric experience.

                  Throughout the project, we followed Gibbs' Reflective Cycle to
                  reflect on our experiences and progress. We started with a
                  brainstorming session, generating potential solutions for
                  sound levels and stress management in physical education
                  classes. Research and evaluation of existing apps provided
                  valuable insights, leading to the development of an
                  interconnected ecosystem centered around a smartwatch app. We
                  visualized the user journey, prioritized features using the
                  MoSCoW Analysis, and collaborated to merge individual
                  prototypes into a cohesive final version. UML diagrams played
                  a crucial role in documenting the system's architecture,
                  fostering effective communication. User feedback and
                  observations guided iterative refinements, resulting in a
                  well-crafted home screen prototype. The feedback analysis
                  highlighted positive aspects, such as visual appeal and
                  usability, while also identifying areas for improvement. We
                  will make necessary adjustments and continue refining the
                  design based on user preferences and stakeholder requirements
                  to achieve our desired outcomes..
