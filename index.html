              The Graduation Internship Portfolio, including the documentation
              of the internship has been crafted in adherence to the guidelines
              provided by Fontys University of Applied Sciences. This
              compilation serves as a reflective showcase of my journey and the
              tasks undertaken during my graduation internship at Cape.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to express my appreciation to Fontys University of Applied
              Sciences and the ICT department for providing students with a wide
              range of partner companies, offering diverse internship
              opportunities. This experience has broadened my career horizons,
              equipping me for a future in the Media Design sector.
            </p>
            <p>
              A special note of thanks goes to Mr. Frank Roosen, my internship
              teacher coordinator, for his consistent support, guidance, and
              patient assistance throughout the writing process. His
              constructive and effective feedback on various versions of the
              Portfolio during the internship has been instrumental.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also extend my gratitude to Soroush, my supervisor at Cape, for
              his guidance, feedback, and trust in my professional capabilities
              during the internship.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would like to acknowledge Silas for providing valuable
              assistance and guidance during meetings, especially in the
              researching phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to my parents, whose
              unwavering support sustained me throughout the four years of study

            <p>
              The graduation internship took place at Cape, a Tilburg-based
              software company specializing in Software-as-a-Service platforms.
              Cape is driven by a passion for innovative technologies that aim
              to enable marketers, designers, and media teams to unleash their
              full potential, allowing them to concentrate on what truly
              matters; the creation of more pertinent and high-performing
              campaigns. This project delves into the settings of the entire
              platform and its functionality. The main goal of the assignment is
              to create a user-friendly and scalable method for non-developers
              to independently create, edit, and manage settings. The desired
              solution includes a clickable interface that allows non-developers
              to manage the settings.

            <h1 class="margin-bottom">Introduction</h1>
            <p>
              Embarking on a transformative exploration of the Design Thinking
              methodology, this portfolio unfolds its narrative by immersing
              itself in the Empathize phase. Here, a deep dive into the current
              state of settings and the nuanced needs of the target audience
              lays the foundation for the subsequent phases. Transitioning to
              the Define phase, the portfolio distills key findings derived from
              meticulous observations and interviews into a concise and
              insightful summary.
            </p>
            <p>
              The journey advances to the Ideate phase, where a panoramic view
              of settings management in diverse SaaS platforms unfolds. A
              meticulous examination of their content in the context of user
              experience and usability is accompanied by a journey through user
              flow and the conceptualization of initial sketches. Advancing
              smoothly, the storyline seamlessly shifts into the Prototype
              phase, where the wireframes are crafted, leading to the creation
              of a prototype.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Testing phase, a comprehensive review of usability analysis
              unfolds, prompting iterations through the prototype.
              Simultaneously, a MoSCoW analysis is crafted, delineating the
              elements earmarked for implementation in the interface and
              establishing their priorities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Concluding with insights and counsel, the portfolio wraps up by
              offering an advice and a self-reflections based on the entire
              internship journey.

                    >The tool for managing campaigns utilizes various channels,
                    including Display, Social, Video, Mobile, and Email, each of
                    which has its own editable specifications within a campaign.
                    These campaigns can encompass modules, markets, languages,
                    brands, and departments, each serving distinct
                    functionalities based on user permissions. The Multimarket
                    functionality allows for the assignment of different markets
                    to a campaign, while languages determine the display
                    language and offer automatic translation capabilities. User
                    roles are customizable and configurable, with permissions
                    determined by the client's subscription. Categories and tags
                    provide filtering and additional information for campaigns,
                    replacing the previous categorization by types. Lastly,
                    campaign status indicates whether a campaign is upcoming,
                    live, or offline, defining its current state. User roles
                    should be fixed for the customers with a space for creating
                    a personalized role. This comprehensive understanding of the
                    tool's components and features is essential for effective
                    campaign management.

                    manage their campaigns. The customization options provided
                    in the customer setup, with configurable settings and the
                    use of JSON format, empower users to tailor campaigns to
                    specific departments, markets, and brands. The incorporation
                    of categories and tags as metadata enhances campaign
                    description and facilitates effective filtration. Moreover,
                    Cape's campaign calendar tool acts as a centralized hub,

                    The survey analysis on self-service main setup indicates
                    varying frequencies of JSON configuration adjustments, with
                    users reporting daily or infrequent modifications, often
                    focusing on Asset Management configurations. Challenges
                    include the risk of making JSON files invalid, difficulties
                    understanding module relationships and user rights, and a
                    reliance on documentation. Critical settings for
                    modification encompass markets, departments, brands,
                    modules, user roles, and rights. Errors are considered
                    critical, with potential to crash the environment, and
                    confidence levels in validating JSON code varied.
                    Frustrations include the perceived complexity for beginners
                    and non-tech individuals. Desired features include a
                    "no-code" solution, user-friendly web forms, graphical
                    interfaces, and integration of default values. Preferences
                    for interaction include web forms and graphical interfaces,
                    with flexibility and customization emphasized, but with the
                    option to fall back to JSON. Concerns include backward
                    compatibility and transitioning from JSON, while respondents
                    also cited familiarity with other self-service tools and
                    willingness to participate in usability testing for a new
                    interface.

                    It's incredibly frustrating that using JSON for setting up
                    the environment not only increases the risk of errors but
                    also imposes a steep learning curve for reading and editing
                    JSON, which is completely unnecessary. This unnecessary
                    complexity makes it excessively difficult for some to make
                    simple changes, and it's a source of continuous frustration.

                  individual actively seeks simplicity and empathizes with
                  colleagues facing similar struggles. This empathy fosters a
                  collaborative team spirit, encouraging exploration of
                  alternative, more user-friendly solutions. The advocacy for
                  efficiency improvements indicates a proactive approach to
                  problem-solving. Ultimately, this individual's journey with
                  JSON involves not just frustration but also presents an
                  opportunity for positive change, teamwork, and a pursuit of
                  more accessible and efficient solutions in the realm of
                  environment setup.

                  As a Product Owner at Cape, the user underscores the
                  imperative of making frequent adjustments to the customer's
                  primary setup environment on a weekly basis, along with the
                  need for daily small-scale modifications, all executed through
                  the JSON format. The user's key insight lies in the
                  recognition of a pressing demand for a no-code solution in
                  managing these environments. This stems from the inherent risk
                  of errors associated with the current method, as well as the
                  complexity of JSON, which hinders wider adoption within the
                  company. To address these challenges effectively, there is a
                  clear call for a more accessible and user-friendly approach to
                  environment management, emphasizing the importance of
                  streamlining tasks and making them more approachable for all

                  user-friendly editing tools, AI-driven translation for JSON,
                  and a reusable ReactJS design aim to singularly address
                  challenges. Implementation of these solutions, envisioned
                  independently, holds the promise of streamlining processes,
                  increasing accessibility, and ensuring long-term adaptability,

                  The dosage timeline screen is a critical component of the user
                  interface design. Through iterative improvements based on
                  feedback and observations from peers, I refined its visual
                  elements. This included adjusting colors to convey meaning
                  (violet for healthy sounds and red for hazards) and
                  incorporating icons and labels for clarity. These iterative
                  enhancements ensure that the prototypes effectively convey
                  valuable insights and provide an intuitive and engaging user
                  experience.

                  feedback on our design choices. I took the lead in conducting
                  usability testing on the dosage timeline screen flow and also
                  performed A/B testing on the latest iterations of the
                  prototype that I developed. Initially, we faced some
                  challenges during the test deployment, which prompted me to
                  make necessary adjustments to the prototype overnight,
                  ensuring a smooth and effective testing experience the
                  following day. This iterative testing process allowed us to
                  gather valuable insights and refine our design to enhance its
                  usability and user satisfaction.

                  In summary, the analysis of the testing sessions reveals a
                  generally successful implementation of the addition of a new
                  brand, department, and market, demonstrating seamless
                  execution and a user-friendly approach. The introduction of a
                  toggle for customization in Task 1 is acknowledged for
                  providing flexibility. However, feedback suggests areas of
                  improvement, particularly in Task 2, where the creation of a
                  new user role highlighted the need for clearer navigation and
                  a more intuitive presentation of roles and permissions. In
                  Task 3, participants recommended streamlining the user
                  interface by reconsidering the terminology used for "Modules."
                  The overall sentiment across Tasks 4 to 8 indicates
                  well-received functionalities, with minor challenges noted in
                  locating options and a desire for more visual representations.
                  User suggestions for merging Channel Management and
                  Publishing, adding connection state indicators, and refining
                  terminology collectively highlight opportunities for enhancing
                  the platform's cohesion and user-friendliness. Participants
                  generally rated their experience positively at a commendable
                  level of 4, with some initial challenges, particularly related
                  to Sidebar visibility, promptly addressed. These insights
                  collectively offer valuable perspectives for refining the
                  platform's clarity and terminology, contributing to an
                  improved and more user-centric experience.

                  As a collaborative team, we utilized the Useberry platform to
                  integrate targeted questions and user flows specific to the
                  sections we designed. This enabled us to gather valuable
                  feedback on our design choices. I took the lead in conducting

                  Throughout the project, we followed Gibbs' Reflective Cycle to
                  reflect on our experiences and progress. We started with a
                  brainstorming session, generating potential solutions for
                  sound levels and stress management in physical education
                  classes. Research and evaluation of existing apps provided
                  valuable insights, leading to the development of an
                  interconnected ecosystem centered around a smartwatch app. We
                  visualized the user journey, prioritized features using the
                  MoSCoW Analysis, and collaborated to merge individual
                  prototypes into a cohesive final version. UML diagrams played
                  a crucial role in documenting the system's architecture,
                  fostering effective communication. User feedback and
                  observations guided iterative refinements, resulting in a
                  well-crafted home screen prototype. The feedback analysis
                  highlighted positive aspects, such as visual appeal and
                  usability, while also identifying areas for improvement. We
                  will make necessary adjustments and continue refining the
                  design based on user preferences and stakeholder requirements
                  to achieve our desired outcomes..
